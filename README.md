This represents collaborative work by the labs of Roger, Wangpraseurt, Putnam on cellular-level coral research, nanobiotechnology and engineering to elucidate the dynamics of free-radical stress (also known as nitro-oxidative stress) and dysbiosis in cnidarian-dinoflagellate mutualistic symbiosis, from molecules to cells, tissues to organisms.
