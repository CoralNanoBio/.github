Although the mechanism of coral bleaching, i.e. dysbiosis between cnidarian host and algal endosymbionts, is not fully known, it is understood that a combination of excess free-radicals, a deficient antioxidant system and innate immune responses are central to the breakdown of symbiosis through cellular damage. The symbiosis between reef-building corals and dinoflagellate algae is at the center of tropical marine ecosystems which support a biodiversity rivaling that of rainforests, an economy worth US$36 billion and over 1 billion people. Environmental stress threatens symbiosis equilibrium, regulatory crosstalk, partner recognition and nutritional exchanges between host and symbiont. Recurrent mass bleaching events recorded for the last two decades have left coral reefs highly degraded, putting in question their survival past 2050. The conservation, restoration and rehabilitation efforts are hindered by a gap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular cascade of symbiotic dysbiosis and coral bleaching, and the free-radical microspatial landscape. We are working on cellular-level coral research, nanobiotechnology and engineering to elucidate the dynamics of free-radical stress (also known as nitro-oxidative stress) and dysbiosis in cnidarian-dinoflagellate mutualistic symbiosis, from molecules to cells, tissues to organisms.
